# PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze the reading and math grades for Thomas High School
ninth graders which appear to have been altered. The school board turned to Maria for help in
upholding state-testing standards. By using the Python program and the Pandas library we are able to
analyze the grades data and uncover some key findings and understand how this affected the overall analysis. 

This information can help auditos like Seth and Tom for current and future election campaigns.
